Hello!

My name is Aharon, I'm a Computer Science student at OCCC.
I work in the Mathematics Dept. as a student worker, and that's where I spend most of my time.


Chess Dice or Chice!

https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html (random number generation - how to make dice?)

I will need to import this module, which is responsible for pseudo(?)-random number generation

One die will have repeat values:

1,1,2,3,4,5
1,2,3,4,5,6
